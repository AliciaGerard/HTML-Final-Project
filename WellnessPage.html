To begin let us define wellness.<br>
"...a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity."- The World Health Organization<br>
<p></p>
It is of great importance to learn to be consciously present and aware, as opposed to on autopilot. 
Mindfulness allows you to have conscious awareness of what you are doing, so you can make choices to override automatic 
thinking and make positive changes in thoughts and behavior. When you are mindful, you are able to observe events in a non-judgmental way,
 which allows you to detach from negative emotions, as opposed to being controlled by them. As a result, the way you respond to 
 events in your life starts to change. Your emotions are better regulated, and you stop getting so upset, angry, or fearful over 
 things you can’t control. You are also not flooding your brain with fear and worry about the future or resentments from the past,
 which has the profoundly positive effect of resetting your emotional state to calm and peaceful.
 In order to experience the life-altering benefits of mindfulness, it is best to practice on a daily basis. Once a week won’t get you there, 
 but 10 minutes a day is enough to start to feel the benefit in a matter of a few days, although you probably won’t start to notice how it is 
 changing your behavior until you’ve been practicing daily for a couple of weeks. You should subtly start to notice you feel calmer and less stressed; 
 things that used to upset you may not bother you so much anymore. You will feel greater clarity in your thinking and ability to focus. 
 To add a mindfulness practice into your routine, it is best to set aside a regular time to do it every day.

 What you take in from your environment matters a great deal to your emotional well-being, because it stays active in your subconscious mental 
 space for a period of time, even after the event is long over.If you would like to experience positive emotional well-being, you need to take 
 in as many positive things from your surroundings as possible, and minimize the number of negative things. Most people don’t pay attention to 
 what they are taking in. If you watch a lot of negative news stories, chronically listen to songs about heartbreak and sadness, frequently watch 
 crime dramas and horror movies, regularly play violent video games, or spend a lot of time listening to other people complain about their lives, 
 that is a steady junk diet of emotional negativity that is bound to drag you down.  To really experience the benefit of inputting the positive, 
 I suggest a two-week environmental detox: Go through your daily routine and remove anything that, when you think of it, feels like it may generate 
 a negative emotion. Turn off the news, disconnect from anyone who drags you into negative conversations, and stop watching or listening to anything sad, 
 violent, or scary. Instead, make a very conscious effort to only give your attention to things that feel positive and uplifting. Listen to music and read 
 books that inspire you, watch videos that make you laugh, spend time with pets and people that are happy, take more walks in nature, keep a gratitude 
 journal, find an inspirational quote and use it as a screen saver.

 One of the most foundational elements of emotional well-being is self-compassion. Without it, you cannot find true happiness. It is impossible to 
 hate yourself and have a good life. Self-compassion is about learning to be kind to yourself and to be self-forgiving of the flaws we all have and 
 the mistakes we all make as human beings.  It is the ultimate form of self-love and a prerequisite to real self-confidence. Many people are so controlled 
 by their inner critic that they find the idea of self-compassion to be something they don’t deserve. Part of whole wellness is also reaching out and 
 being social with others. Community makes people feel safe an included. And when we show love and compassion to other people, it 
 releases chemicals in the pre-frontal cortex and reward center of the brain that professionals refer to as the "Helper’s High." People who help others report 
 many positive mental and physical health benefits, including lower levels of stress, lower blood pressure, and relief from depression and physical pain. 
 Research also shows that those who engage in altruistic behavior not only have a higher quality of life, but they also live longer.
