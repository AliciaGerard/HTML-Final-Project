# HTML-Final-Project
This is the final project for HTML5 
The goal of the project was to create a web page that had several key elements we went over in class.
 - We had to create a website with at least 3 pages branching from the home page.
 - The page had to be able to have a small or large browser window without losing too much fidelity 
 -There had to be an image map linking to something, I chose to have it link to the other pages. 
    - The woman doing yoga with the star icons on the front page
    - currently does not work, some error I am looking for when I uploaded it to github
    
 - There had to be at least three image links that linked to outside websites
    - For this I used the three images on the Defining Wellness page 
 - All text needed to be displayed in a cohesive and responsive to the size of the window
 - Must have a table with multiple colors and multiple cell ranges
     - this is on the exercise page
 - There must be an image with a label
    -Exercise page with the man and woman 
 - It must also have a up to date weather widget to display the current weather
    - Exercise page on the bottom
 - Must have a in browser video 
    - Nutritional Facts page
 - Large CSS requirements such has having a certain amount of colors and use of the border radius, 
    padding, hovers, on clicks and other things to make it look nice. 
    - I think I largely accomplished the task set out, sure I could have made it prettier, more modern,
      but I couldn't think of a way to do that and create the specifics in CSS the professor wanted and
      I wanted something consice and to the point while being professional.
